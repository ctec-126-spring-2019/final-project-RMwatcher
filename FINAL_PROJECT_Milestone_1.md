# Final Project Milestone 1

## Specifications

For my final project for this quarter which consists of three web pages, I've decided for one of the web pages to create a straight forward card game involving numbers, a more detailed form page, and a online recipe. 

**For all three web pages, I'm planning to be working by myself.**

## Web page 1

For one of my web pages will involve 11 playing cards which only 5 of them will be used, selected at random each time you press a button. You'll have a number bewteen 2 through 12 which simulate two 6 sided dices rolled at the same time to give us two numbers added together (1 + 1 = 2, 3 + 5 = 8, etc.). This is inspired by a minigame I used to play from a video game long ago only simplified.

The object of the game is to have the browser display a number which simulate rolling two pairs of dice by pressing a button. This will starts a timer that displays a number every few seconds until we get 5 different numbers. We then compare the numbers we 'rolled' to our cards that is displayed. If we have a card with a matching number, it slides up and we get a point. If we get at least 3 cards or points out of the 5 turns we win.

## Other details

The numbers 2 and 12 hold special meaning to this game. Getting a 2 will give you one extra turn; however, getting a 12 will results in a game over regardless of how many turns have passed or whether you have at least 3 matching cards. 

You will have the following cards: **3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11** (the jack card will act as 11). All cards are selected at random for you so this game is based entirely on luck. The order of the cards in which get selected don't matter and the cards don't need to be next to each other for you to earn a point. A special message will appear if you either roll a 2 or 12 and how many cards you obtain. A special message will appear telling you how you did regardless if you won or not. 

## Web page 2

For this web page, I will have a more detailed form page for the user to fill out similar to how you would fill out a form if you wanting to gain membership to a website. 

It will be required that all fields in this form to be filled out otherwise it won't submit. If any fields are missing, the browser will let the user know by displaying a list of what's missing and text next to the empty field. Similar to lab 11 with the additional to fieldsets and legends for presentation as well as more fields to fill out.

## Other details

Changes to the style will be apparent when any requried field is missing which include bold font, list of fields missing appearing top and bottom of page and text appearing next to field. The cursor will go to the first field from the top that needs to be filled out if one or more fields are missing. With permission from the instructor, the CTEC 122 form processor will be used to show the values the user has entered into the forms. 

## Web page 3

This web page will display an online recipe, that people can go find, with a twist. For the list of ingredients,you have the option of setting the units of measurements to either to the american system (ounces, fahrenheit) to the metirc system (grams, celsius) which you can change with a click of a button. 

The recipe will display on the webpage (with some pictures) as normal, but for the measurements, it won't appear at first. You'll be asked to choose a unit of measurements from the american or metric system (ounces, fahrenheit or grams, celsius). To make the page more unique, the directions that follow will fade in onto the page after a few seconds. A loop will be used to display the directions one by one.

## Other details

The measurements for each ingredients will be measured out in advance and the browser will display them based on which options the user selected. If necessary, the directions section will show the changes if any measurements are involved as well as ajustment to any temperatures involved in the process. The changes will be displayed in a different font style (bold, italic, different font color, etc.) to help show what has been changes once they made their measurement choices.
