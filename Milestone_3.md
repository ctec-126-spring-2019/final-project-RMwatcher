# Final Project Milestone 3

## Progress

The form site is coming along pretty good so far, may add some more input fields later and start working on the CSS for that page to make it look more professional.

For the online recipe site finally got it to where when you press a button for the unit of measurements you want, it'll display the measurements next to the ingredients and other places it calls for measurements. Working out the directions showing up as planned and deciding whether or not I can get the different unit of measurements to show up on the directions in time or I just write out both measurements on the html instead, also to have it fade in when you click on a unit of measurements.

Making good progress on my card/dice game website. Manage to get a space to where my cards will appear and an area where the numbers (which represents the value of rolling two dice) to appear in it seperate area. All I have to do is have it where 5 cards will appear at a time, get it to display 1 number at a time for 5 times, have a card slide up if you have it on your hand and setting up my if statements that'll match the value of the cards on your hand. Still a ways to go but I feel I'm making some progress. I also will like to point out that I deleted the hearts cards (3 of hearts through jack of hearts) seeing that I made get duplicate cards on the table which I don't want so I just have the spades card on my img folder.
