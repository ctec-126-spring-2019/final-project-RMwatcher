# Final Project Milestone 2

## Progress

Finish the content of what I wanted to look like for my recipe webpage and in the process of setting up the JavaScript file for that page just working on getting what I want it to do to display properly.

For my form page getting my form all set up which I set it up to have their own fieldset and legend tags to help space them out more. I'm in the process of setting the JavaScript file so it'll let the user know if they still have fields to fill out still

For my playing card game I'm beginning the process of getting it set up to build the hand the player will be using. Still need to make sure the cards you have to play with is all random between the 9 cards which 5 will be used as a hand.

I'm planning to work on the CSS files of all webpages once I have a good handle on the content and the JavaScript file.
